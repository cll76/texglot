## News

- **2026-09-25**: 🔥 TeXGlot for Zotero is released: start translations, reuse existing results and read both PDFs side by side inside Zotero. [Plugin guide](integrations/zotero/README.md)
- **2026-09-10**: The first public TeXGlot release brings local arXiv / LaTeX translation, PDF comparison and a CLI.

## Overview

**TeXGlot** takes an arXiv link or a LaTeX project, translates its prose with your configured language model, and compiles a translated PDF. Equations, citations, figures and document structure are protected throughout the process. The translated LaTeX project remains available for editing.

Local text PDFs are also supported. Translations are fitted into the original text regions, retaining page count, images, vector graphics and standalone formulas. Inline formulas are protected as images. Text can shrink moderately; failed translations or text that cannot fit stay unchanged with a warning. Scans need OCR first. Check complex formula fonts and layouts in the result. PDF inputs need no TeX compiler and do not produce LaTeX source.

PDF progress counts translatable text regions, including headings and captions outside figures. Labels, axes and legends inside bitmap or vector illustrations stay unchanged, are not sent to the model and do not count toward translation progress. Detected prose continuations across pages or columns are translated together with whole-paragraph context and reconstructed broken words, then fitted back into their original regions. Running headers do not join prose; headings, captions and references remain separate. Resuming an older job retranslates changed paragraph groups and reuses valid caches for unchanged standalone regions.

Inline bold headings and the body text beside them are reconstructed as one physical line before grouping paragraphs, avoiding fragmented sentences and overlapping translations. Sentences can continue below page-top figures and captions. Display formulas stay unchanged and supply read-only context to surrounding text.

The name combines **TeX + Polyglot**. The browser interface and CLI use the same local library, queue and translation cache. No TeXGlot account or hosted backend is required. Model requests go to the API endpoint you choose.

## Features

| | What you can do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source to PDF** | Import arXiv links/IDs or `.tex`, `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.gz` projects. Download the translated PDF, original PDF and translated source ZIP. |
| **Local PDF** | Use an LLM API to upload a PDF with extractable text in **Local file**, preserving layout, images and formulas where possible. Download the translation or read it beside the original. DeepL supports arXiv / LaTeX sources. |
| **Your model** | Use DeepL, Qwen / Alibaba Model Studio, DeepSeek, or a compatible Chat Completions or Anthropic Messages endpoint, including reverse proxies and local model services. |
| **Context guidance** | Optionally use the paper's abstract to guide terminology. On by default; independently selectable for each task in the GUI and CLI. |
| **Reading workspace** | Read original, translation or both; swap sides, scroll continuously, synchronize by shared content landmarks, search the full PDF with Cmd/Ctrl+F, zoom and resume your reading position. |
| **Local annotations** | Highlight, underline and add notes. Search and manage annotations in a sidebar; exported PDFs stay free of TeXGlot annotations. |
| **Batch & resume** | Translate multiple papers from the terminal, resume interrupted tasks, reuse valid paragraph caches and export machine-readable results. |
| **Desktop updates** | Get release reminders, download a verified installer and open it from the app. [Update guide](docs/desktop.md#update-reminders). |

## Quick start

### 1. Download and install

Choose the **desktop installer** for your computer from [Releases](https://github.com/Mengqi-Lei/texglot/releases):

| Computer | Installer | Install |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mac · Apple Silicon | `TeXGlot-1.2.1-macOS-arm64.dmg` | Open and drag into Applications |
| Mac · Intel | `TeXGlot-1.2.1-macOS-x64.dmg` | Open and drag into Applications |
| Windows · x64 | `TeXGlot-1.2.1-Windows-x64-Setup.exe` | Run setup and open the desktop shortcut |

Python, the interface and Tectonic are included. **No Python, Node.js or uv installation is required.** First compilation downloads TeX packages and fonts; papers with EPS figures additionally require Ghostscript. The initial packages have no publisher signing certificate / Apple notarization, so the OS may show an unknown-publisher warning. See the [desktop guide](docs/desktop.md) for installation, migration and platform validation. Only verified assets are attached to a release.

<details>
<summary>Install from source (developers and CLI users)</summary>

Download and extract **`texglot-1.2.1-source.zip`** from [Releases](https://github.com/Mengqi-Lei/texglot/releases), or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mengqi-Lei/texglot.git
cd texglot
```

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and [Node.js 22.12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download), then reopen your terminal. Setup prepares Python 3.13, builds the interface and installs the CLI. It reuses an installed Tectonic compiler, or downloads a checksum-verified portable copy. The first installation and first compilation need internet access for dependencies, TeX packages and fonts.

**macOS**

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
bash start-texglot.command
```

After installation, you can also double-click `start-texglot.command` in Finder.

**Windows 10/11 x64**

Double-click `install-texglot.cmd`, then `start-texglot.cmd`. Alternatively, in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\install-texglot.cmd
.\start-texglot.cmd
```

No WSL is required. For source installations, prefer a short folder such as `D:\TeXGlot`. The Apple Silicon desktop app was tested locally. Intel Mac and Windows x64 passed native builds and frozen-engine translation checks; Windows also passed EXE installation. See [platform details](docs/platforms.en.md) for interactive desktop and Linux test coverage.

</details>

### 2. Connect a translation service

Open **TeXGlot** (or **http://127.0.0.1:8765** for a source installation), choose **Translation settings**, select a provider, enter its API base URL, model and key, then **Test connection** and save.

| Provider | Model preset | API base URL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Qwen / Alibaba Model Studio | `qwen3.8-flash` | Copy the **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint from your workspace's API Key page. It must match the key's region and workspace. |
| DeepSeek V4.1 Flash | `deepseek-flash` | `https://api.deepseek.com` |
| DeepL | No model name needed | `https://api.deepl.com`; legacy Free keys automatically use the Free endpoint. |
| Custom / proxy / local | Your installed or available model | HTTP and HTTPS are supported. Enter the base URL (including `/v1` if needed) and select Chat Completions or Anthropic Messages. Full endpoint URLs are also accepted. For example, `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama. A local endpoint without authentication can use an empty key. |

Presets are editable. Model availability and billing depend on your provider account. Qwen requests disable thinking by default. Refer to the [Qwen quick start](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/first-api-call-to-qwen) or [DeepSeek documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) for credentials and endpoint details.

Choose Chat Completions or Anthropic Messages in **API protocol**; the request URL appears below the endpoint. Name and save API profiles, including multiple profiles for the same address with different protocols, models or keys. Select a profile and click **Save settings** to apply it. Profiles can be updated, copied or deleted. Editing the endpoint retains the key you entered or saved.

DeepL uses its own **DeepL API key** and does not require an LLM account. Select DeepL, test the connection and save; usage is shown in characters. TeXGlot protects and validates formulas, citations and formatting. Optionally provide a DeepL glossary ID and its source language; existing free-form LLM terminology preferences are retained. See [DeepL API authentication](https://developers.deepl.com/docs/getting-started/auth) for API account requirements.

### 3. Translate and read

Paste an arXiv link, or upload a LaTeX project including its figures, bibliography and template files. Choose the target language and context guidance, then click **Translate**. Open the result to compare the PDFs or download the translated source.

The interface starts in Chinese; use **EN** in the header to switch. The empty library's **Translate Attention Is All You Need** action downloads the pinned arXiv paper and translates it using your selected target language, context guidance and configured API. Quit the desktop app through its menu. For a source installation, close the launch terminal or press `Ctrl+C` to stop the foreground service; your library is retained.

## Example: Attention Is All You Need

Try the original Transformer paper, pinned to [arXiv:1706.03762v7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7):

```bash
texglot https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7 --language zh --context-guidance -o ./translated
```

The [bilingual walkthrough](examples/attention-is-all-you-need/README.md) covers the GUI, CLI, expected artifacts and result checks. A one-line [batch file](examples/attention-is-all-you-need/papers.txt) is included. This is a real model-backed translation and incurs your provider's normal usage charges.

The example downloads source from arXiv when you run it. The repository does not redistribute the paper, its source archive or its full translation.

## Command line

Desktop packages include a [CLI engine](docs/desktop.md#bundled-command-line); source or wheel installation provides the shorter commands below. No browser needs to be open:

```bash
texglot --configure                         # interactive setup; hidden key input
texglot 1706.03762v7                         # one paper
texglot ./paper.tex ./project.zip -o ./out   # multiple inputs
texglot --batch papers.txt --language zh    # one source per line
texglot --batch papers.txt --no-context-guidance
texglot --resume TASK_ID                    # resume, wait or export
texglot --list
texglot --serve                             # foreground local web service
```

If the command is not found, run `uv tool update-shell` and reopen the terminal. From the checkout, `uv run python -m app.cli` accepts the same arguments.

Batch lists support comments and resolve relative input paths from the list's directory. Each task exports into a separate folder. A failed paper does not stop later papers unless you pass `--fail-fast`. `--json` writes results to stdout and progress to stderr; exit code `1` includes partial translations that need review. See the [complete CLI guide](docs/cli.en.md).

## Zotero plugin

**TeXGlot for Zotero** lets you start paper translations, reuse results from your TeXGlot library and read the original and translation side by side in Zotero's native reader. Translations become child attachments of the paper; existing PDFs and annotations are preserved. The plugin works with TeXGlot running on the same computer.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/zotero-reader.png" width="100%" alt="TeXGlot Zotero plugin: English original on the left, Chinese translation on the right, with the Transformer diagram and synchronized scrolling controls"></p>

For installation, translation, reading controls and troubleshooting, see the **[Zotero plugin guide](integrations/zotero/README.md)**.

## How translation works

1. **Import and preflight.** Safely unpack the source, find the main file and compile the original. Check the target-language font/template before model translation.
2. **Protect and translate.** Extract prose, protect LaTeX syntax, formulas and references with markers, then call the configured model with bounded concurrency.
3. **Use context when enabled.** Share the explicitly marked source abstract across paragraphs, up to 6,000 characters. No readable abstract means no added context. Turning guidance off removes this background, while terminology and structure protection still apply.
4. **Validate and cache.** Check protected markers, structure and target language. Retry invalid output; preserve the original paragraph and report a partial result if recovery fails. Save successful translations for resumption.
5. **Compile and export.** Rebuild the LaTeX project into a searchable PDF and retain editable source. Read the result locally with content-based synchronization.

## Data and privacy

- Source installations store settings, tasks, caches and annotations in **`data/`**; desktop and standalone wheel installations use **`~/.texglot/`**. `TEXGLOT_DATA_DIR` overrides the location. Back up this directory before moving or upgrading an installation.
- API keys are stored locally, **not encrypted at rest**. Configuration files use owner-only permissions on macOS/Linux and the containing user's ACL on Windows. API responses do not expose saved keys. Editing a connection's address preserves its key; switching saved profiles loads each profile's own key.
- Translation paragraphs, optional abstract context and your glossary are sent to your chosen model service. Source processing, compilation and annotation storage run locally. Use a local model endpoint if the text must remain on your machine.
- The service binds to loopback. It is a personal local application, not an authenticated multi-user server. macOS uses an OS compilation sandbox; Windows/Linux do not yet provide equivalent OS-level file isolation. Use trusted LaTeX sources.
